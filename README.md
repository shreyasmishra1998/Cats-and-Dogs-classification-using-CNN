# Cats-and-Dogs-classification-using-CNN

In this project I have used the Kaggle Cats v Dogs dataset which contained about 12500 images each of cats and dogs. A sequential model was used and in the end I obtained a training accuracy of about 84% and validation accuracy of about 88% after running 10 epochs.
The entire notebook has been written in Google Colab
